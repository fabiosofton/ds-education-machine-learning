# Q1
#

# We want to explore the tissue_gene_expression predictors by plotting them.

data("tissue_gene_expression")
dim(tissue_gene_expression$x) # dimension of the matrix
# [1] 189 500

# We want to get an idea of which observations are close to each other, but, as
# you can see from the dimensions, the predictors are 500-dimensional, making
# plotting difficult. Plot the first two principal components (PC) with color
# representing tissue type.

tissue_gene_expression$x[1,]         # This is the first row
length(tissue_gene_expression$x[1,]) # 500 is the number of predictors
tissue_gene_expression$x[,1]         # This is the first column
length(tissue_gene_expression$x[,1]) # 189 is the number of observations by tissue
tissue_gene_expression$x[1,1]        # 9.82568 (for cerebellum_1, MAML1 predictor)

ftf <- cbind(tissue_gene_expression$x[,1], tissue_gene_expression$x[,2])

# [1] 189   
# [,1]      [,2]
# cerebellum_1    9.825680  8.327163
# cerebellum_2    9.631247  8.542827

#
# Q2
#

# The predictors for each observation are measured using the same device and
# experimental procedure. This introduces biases that can affect all the
# predictors from one observation. For each observation, compute the average
# across all predictors, and then plot this against the first PC with color
# representing tissue. Report the correlation.

# Instructor answer - I did not get it right

# PCA but only after removing the center. Part of the code is provided for you.

# For the first 10 PCs, make a boxplot showing the values for each tissue.

# For the 7th PC, which two tissues have the greatest median difference?
# Select the TWO tissues that have the greatest median difference.

# Q5

# Plot the percent variance explained by PC number. Hint: use the summary
# function.

# How many PCs are required to reach a cumulative percent variance explained
# greater than 50%?

# a classmate created a data frame from the summary() function to get importance
# and added a few more # fields ... the cumulative sum and an index for the PCs.
