# Variable Importance
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Earlier we described that one of the limitations of random forest is that
# they're not very interpretable. However, the concept of variable importance
# helps a little bit in this regard. Unfortunately, the current implementation
# of the Rborist package does not yet support variable importance calculations.

# So to demonstrate the concept the variable importance, we're going to use the
# random forest function in the random forest package. Furthermore, we're not
# going to filter any columns out of the feature matrix out. We're going to use
# them all. So the code will look like this.

library(randomForest)
rf <- randomForest(x, y,  ntree = 50)

# Once we run this, we can compute the importance of each feature using the
# important function. So we would type something like this.

imp <- importance(rf)
imp
# MeanDecreaseGini
# 1         0.00000000
# 2         0.00000000
# 3         0.00000000
# 4         0.00000000 Etc. -> 784 rows

# If you look at the importance, we immediately see that the first few features
# have zero importance. They're never used in the prediction algorithm. This
# makes sense because these are the features on the edges, the features that
# have no writing in them, no dark pixels in them.

# In this particular example, it makes sense to explore the importance of this
# feature using an image. We'll make an image where each feature is plotted in
# the location of the image where it came from. So we can use this code.

image(matrix(imp, 28, 28))

# And we see where the important features are. It makes a lot of sense. They're
# in the middle, where the writing is. And you can kind of see the different
# numbers there-- six, eight, seven. These are the features that distinguish one
# digit from another. An important part of data science is visualizing results
# to discern why we're failing. How we do this depends on the application. For
# the examples with the digits, we'll find digits for which we were quite
# certain of a call, but it was incorrect. We can compare what we got with
# k-nearest neighbors to what we got with random forest. So we can write code
# like this and then make images of the cases where we made a mistake. Here they
# are.

# [SEE EXAMPLE GRID IN BOOK]

# That first one was called a zero. It's actually a two. You can kind of see
# why. The second one was called a four, but it's a six. That one you definitely
# see why we made a mistake, et cetera. But by looking at these images, you
# might get ideas of how you could improve your algorithm. We can do the same
# for random forest. Here are the top 12 cases where we were very sure it was
# one digit, when it was, in fact, another.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Ensembles
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A very powerful approach in machine learning is the idea of ensembling
# different machine learning algorithms into one. Let's explain what we mean by
# that.

# The idea of an ensemble is similar to the idea of combining data from
# different pollsters to obtain a better estimate of the true support for
# different candidates.

# In machine learning, one can usually greatly # improve the final result of our
# predictions by combining the results of # different algorithms.

# Here we present a very simple example, where we compute new class
# probabilities by taking the average of the class probabilities provided by
# random forest and k-nearest neighbors.

# We can use this code to simply average these probabilities. And we can see
# that once we do this, when we form the prediction, we actually improve the
# accuracy over both k-nearest neighbors and random forest.

# Now, notice, in this very simple example, we ensemble just two methods. In
# practice, we might ensemble dozens or even hundreds of different methods. And
# this really provides substantial improvements.
