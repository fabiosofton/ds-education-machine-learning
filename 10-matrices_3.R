# Indexing with Matrices and Binarizing the Data
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For our next challenge, we want to be able to look at a histogram of all our
# pixels. We already saw how we can turn vectors into matrices, but we can also
# undo this and turn matrices into vectors. Here's how it works. It's the
# function as vector. Here's an example.

mat <- matrix(1:15, 5, 3)
mat
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    6   11
#> [2,]    2    7   12
#> [3,]    3    8   13
#> [4,]    4    9   14
#> [5,]    5   10   15
as.vector(mat)
#>  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15

# So to see a histogram of all our predictors, we can simply type this code.

qplot(as.vector(x), bins = 30, color = I("black"))

# When we look at this plot we see a clear dichotomy which is explained as parts
# with ink and parts without ink. If we think that values below say, 25, are
# smudges, we can quickly make them zero using this very simple code.

new_x <- x
new_x[new_x < 50] <- 0

# To see what this does, let's look at a smaller matrix at a smaller example.
# Type this code and notice what happens.

mat <- matrix(1:15, 5, 3)
mat[mat < 3] <- 0
mat
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    0    6   11
#> [2,]    0    7   12
#> [3,]    3    8   13
#> [4,]    4    9   14
#> [5,]    5   10   15

# It changes all the values that are less than three to zero. We can also use
# more complicated logical operations with matrices like this. Here's an example
# where we zero out all the values that are between 6 and 12.

mat <- matrix(1:15, 5, 3)
mat[mat > 6 & mat <12] <- 0
mat
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    6    0
#> [2,]    2    0   12
#> [3,]    3    0   13
#> [4,]    4    0   14
#> [5,]    5    0   15

# Now for the next challenge, we want a binarize the data. The histogram we just
# saw suggests that this data is mostly binary pixels, are either ink or no ink.
# Using what we've learned, we can binarize the data using just matrix
# operations. For example, using this code we turn all the values below 255
# divided by 2 to 0 and above it to 1.

bin_x <- x
bin_x[bin_x < 255/2] <- 0 
bin_x[bin_x > 255/2] <- 1

# But we can also convert it to a matrix using logicals and coerce it into
# numbers like this.

bin_X <- (x > 255/2)*1

# Here's an example showing that by converting things into 0 and 1 we don't lose
# that much information. The figure on the left includes all the pixel values.
# The picture on the right is binarized. You can see it's three.

# Vectorization for Matrices and Matrix Algebra Operations
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For our final challenge in which we're standardizing the rows or the columns,
# we're going to use vectorization. In R, we subtract a vector from a matrix,
# the first element of each vector is subtracted from the first row of the
# matrix. The second element from the vector is subtracted from the second row
# of the matrix and so on. So using mathematical notation, we would write it
# like this. This is what R does when you subtract a vector from a matrix. The
# same holds true for other arithmetic operations. This implies that we can
# scale each row of a matrix using this simple code.

(x - rowMeans(x)) / rowSds(x)

# Now, if you want to scale each column, be careful because it does not work for
# columns. For columns, we would have to transpose a matrix. So we would have to
# do it like this.

t(t(X) - colMeans(X))

# We transpose the matrix, subtract the columns, and then transpose it back. For
# this task, we can also use a function call sweep, which works in a similar way
# to apply. It takes each entry of a vector and subtracts it from the
# corresponding row or column. So for example, in this code, we take each
# column. There's a two there. That tells you it's a column. And it subtracts
# the column mean from each column and returns the new matrix.
# 
X_mean_0 <- sweep(x, 2, colMeas(x))

# Now, the function sweep actually has an other argument that lets you define
# the arithmetic operation. By default, it's subtraction. But we can change it.
# So to divide by the standard deviation, we can do the following.

x_mean_0 <- sweep(x, 2, colMeans(x))
x_standardized <- sweep(x_mean_0, 2, colSds(x), FUN = "/")

# So we have seen powerful ways in which we can use matrix algebra in R to
# perform certain tasks. Finally, although we do not cover matrix algebra
# operations such as matrix multiplication, we share here the relevant commands
# for those that know the mathematics and want to learn the code.

# Matrix multiplication is done with percent star # percent. So the
# cross-product, for example, can be written like this.

t(x) %*% x

# We can compute the cross-product directly with the function with that name.
# cross product x gives us as the cross-product.

crossprod(x)

# To compute the inverse of a function, we use solve. Here it is applied to the
# cross-product.

solve(crossprod(x))

# Finally, the qr decomposition is readily available by using the qr
# function like this.

qr(x)
